## Conclusion

While Budapest housing has provided solid returns over the past 15 years, the S&P 500 has significantly outperformed on a total return basis, especially when considering inflation. However, Budapest real estate offers unique advantages including leverage, rental income, and potential for higher returns in specific premium segments.

The choice between the two depends on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and portfolio diversification needs. Budapest real estate may be more suitable for investors seeking stable income and long-term capital appreciation, while the S&P 500 offers higher liquidity and potentially higher total returns for those comfortable with market volatility.
